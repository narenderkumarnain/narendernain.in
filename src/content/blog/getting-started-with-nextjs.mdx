# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications. Combined with TypeScript, it provides a powerful and type-safe development experience. In this post, I'll walk you through setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript and explain some of the key features that make Next.js a great choice for modern web development.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over a standard React application:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Next.js can render your pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - You can pre-render pages at build time, resulting in fast page loads and better user experience.
3. **File-based Routing** - Next.js uses a file-based routing system, making it intuitive to create new pages.
4. **API Routes** - You can create API endpoints within your Next.js application.
5. **Built-in CSS and Sass Support** - Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass, making styling your application easier.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project with TypeScript

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
cd my-app
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript support. The `--typescript` flag tells Next.js to set up the project with TypeScript configuration.

## Project Structure

After creating your project, you'll see a directory structure like this:

```
my-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   └── globals.css
├── .eslintrc.json
├── .gitignore
├── next-env.d.ts
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── README.md
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

Let's go through some of the key files and directories:

- **src/app/**: This is where your application code lives. With the App Router, each folder represents a route segment.
- **src/app/page.tsx**: This is the main page of your application.
- **src/app/layout.tsx**: This defines the layout that wraps around your pages.
- **public/**: This directory is used for static assets like images and fonts.
- **next.config.js**: This file is used to customize the Next.js configuration.
- **tsconfig.json**: This file contains TypeScript configuration for your project.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js with the App Router, creating a new page is as simple as creating a new directory with a `page.tsx` file. For example, to create an "About" page, you would create a file at `src/app/about/page.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page of our Next.js application.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data for your pages. Here's an example of fetching data in a page component:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
  }
  
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data from API</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Styling Your Application

Next.js supports various styling methods, including CSS Modules, Sass, and CSS-in-JS libraries. Here's an example of using CSS Modules:

1. Create a CSS file with the `.module.css` extension, e.g., `Button.module.css`:

```css
.button {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  background-color: #0070f3;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #0051a2;
}
```

2. Import and use the styles in your component:

```tsx
import styles from './Button.module.css';

export default function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className={styles.button}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js with TypeScript provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. With features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing, it simplifies many aspects of web development while maintaining the flexibility and power of React.

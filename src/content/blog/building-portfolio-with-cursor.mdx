# Building My Portfolio with Cursor AI

Cursor has identified a significant challenge in the AI coding tool space: **integration**. By seamlessly incorporating powerful models like Claude and GPT-4 into a familiar VS Code environment, Cursor has significantly enhanced developer productivity.

<br>

While I'm well aware of the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and how they can impact product quality if not used responsibly, I decided to experiment with my portfolio site. I provided a loose design palette and acted as a quality assurance (QA) guide, identifying issues and suggesting improvements.

<br>

After just **5 hours**, I had a beautiful portfolio website ready for deployment. However, I encountered some challenges along the way:

- I was unable to guide the AI in the exact direction I wanted to build. As the complexity of the project increased, the AI often fell into a loop of repeating the same mistakes again and again.
- Changing LLMs did not yield better results; I had to deeply understand the code and provide feedback on architectural choices and other ideas.


<br>

This experience demonstrated that AI tools are most effective when used as intelligent assistants rather than complete replacements. Proper integration is key to maintaining development efficiency without compromising quality.

In conclusion, while Cursor AI significantly accelerated the initial development of my portfolio, the need for human oversight and guidance became increasingly apparent as the project progressed. This balance between AI assistance and human expertise is crucial for achieving the best results in software development.
